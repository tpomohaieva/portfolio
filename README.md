## About me
Hello, world! My name is Tetiana Pomohaieva, and I am a switcher :) 

My whole life I've enjoyed helping people and my long path in support and management area is a proof of that. My journey in IT has begun at 2020 when I started working as a technical support expert where I've developed interest in programming first by creating useful documentation on that matter, then by starting coding myself.

I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills in quality assurance where I could use both my coding and soft skills. QA is one the most crucial areas for any company, since without high quality product or service you can't guarantee your business to succeed. Thanks to my diversified experience I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy, which helps me see the bigger picture and function well within a team. My international experience has also equipped me with valuable tools, such as open-mindedness and adaptability. 

In this portfolio I would like to share my knowledge and exhibit my technical skills. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field.
